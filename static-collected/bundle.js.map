Keywords should be\n              separated by white spaces and can mix words from different fields\n              (e.g. 'machine learning London' or 'neuron computational\n              modeling'). You can filter results to display only profiles from\n              under-represented countries (list based on the\n              <a\n                href=\"https://datahelpdesk.worldbank.org/knowledgebase/articles/906519-world-bank-country-and-lending-groups\"\n                target=\"_blank\"\n                >World's Bank</a\n              >\n              list of Low, Lower-Middle and Upper-Middle income economies as of\n              August 2017).\n            </p>\n\n            <p class=\"m-1\">\n              Look at the profile provided by the researcher and Google them for\n              other profiles (e.g. LinkedIn, institution, ResearchGate, …). Read\n              the recommendations if any, making sure they are sound (e.g. if\n              Recommender A says 'great talk at OHBM 2017', check the OHBM 2017\n              program and maybe watch the video if available). Important note:\n              the researchers are sole responsible for their profiles and we\n              cannot guarantee authenticity.\n            </p>\n\n            <p class=\"m-1\">\n              It is a vicious circle: researchers need to be known to get\n              invited as speakers but they need to be invited as speaker to get\n              known. This cycle can be broken by taking a chance and inviting\n              someone less recognized. Don't forget that younger scientists also\n              have things to say and they might be more approachable/committed.\n            </p>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"card\">\n        <div class=\"card-header\" id=\"heading-resources\">\n          <h5 class=\"mb-0\">\n            <button\n              class=\"btn btn-link link-secondary\"\n              data-toggle=\"collapse\"\n              data-target=\"#resources\"\n              aria-expanded=\"true\"\n              aria-controls=\"resources\"\n              style=\"white-space:normal\"\n            >\n              What if I don't find a suitable candidate?
